**OLD README:**

This repo is a zero-dependency [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)-embedded [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for expressing [constraint satisfaction problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem). It has a permissive license. 

I can be used together with `reqT-lang` (permissive license) and `reqT-jacop` (AGPL-v3).
