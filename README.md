# reqT-solver

* **reqT-solver** is a [constraint satisfaction problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) (CSP) solver written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) based on the [constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) Java-library [JaCoP](https://github.com/radsz/jacop). 

* **reqT-solver** can solve integer constraint problems that are expressed using [reqT-constraints](https://github.com/reqT/reqT-constraints), a zero-dependncy Scala-embedded domain-specific language (DSL).

* **reqT-solver** is used by the requirements engineering tool [reqT](https://github.com/reqT/reqT)
